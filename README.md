## How to run
1. Bundle all source code starting with `.cpp`
2. Edit `Data\file\*.dat` for your execution environment.
3. If your execution environment is non-Windows?
    - Remove Windows-related code at `Windows_API.cpp` and all related code files.
    - Remove PlaySound Function at `main_content.cpp` and `main.cpp`.
4. If your execution environment is Windows?
    - Link `winmm.lib` to linker to play background music. 
5. Select between `main_show-v1.cpp` and `main_show-v2.cpp` according to your environment.
